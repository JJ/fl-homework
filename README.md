Instructions
---

I guess you are already in GitHub. You know you should be, right?

1. [Fork this repo](https://github.com/JJ/fl-homework/fork). Change
the name to the title of your book, novel, pamphlet, letter, whatever.
2. [Sign up for Travis](http://travis-ci.org) and
[activate continuous integration for your new repo](https://travis-ci.org/profile).
3. Your text should go in the [`text` directory](text/). Any `.txt` or
`.md` file will be checked.
4. Every time you change your text, `commit` and `push` as usual. If
you do it on the web, no need to do any of this.
5. Some words will not be in the dicctionary; just add them to
[`words.dic`](text/words.dic) remembering to update the first line,
which is the number of words in it. 

That's basically it. If you run into trouble, use
[issues](https://github.com/JJ/fl-homework/issues) to request help.
