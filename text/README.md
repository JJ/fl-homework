Persons that don't actually wait for trains - a story
========================

This the beginning of an exercise I did for a
[FutureLearn course on writing fiction](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/start-writing-fiction/). 

It includes a few stories, [Rub the Rube](rub.md) and [Persons that don't actually wait for trains](text.md) and [Crack the kraken](elopus-reg.md). 

Maybe it will include more in the future. Who knows.
