Rub the rube
=====

"Rub the baby with lard", Old Toothless Ted said, "r"s actually
missing from from the sentence, turned into a slight elongation of the
closest vowel. "Uub", that's what he said, "laad".

I looked, slack-jawed, at him. You do not waste a perfectly good piece
of lard, Or anything else that is not rubbing your
innards and those of your mates at the jungle. 

Maybe he had said "talc", that is, "taac"? When that word was coming out of his
toothless mouth, the Tacoma coal train was coming in at the far end of
the rail yard, humming and singing and generally making a racket that,
for a moment, hid the wail of the newborn baby. Baby that, in the
hands of Missouri Big Mama Winnie looked like a new potato, pink and
minute in her grayish-brown huge hands. A new, crying potato that was
about to be rubbed. With lard. Or talc.
