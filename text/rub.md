Rub the rube
=====

"Rub the baby with lard", Old Toothless Ted said.

I looked, slack-jawed, at him. You do not waste a perfectly good piece
of lard in rubbing babies, Or anything else that is not rubbing your
innards and those of your mates at the jungle. 

Maybe he had said "talc"? When that word was coming out of his
toothless mouth, the Tacoma coal train was coming in at the far end of
the rail yard, humming and singing and generally making a racket that,
for a moment, hid the wail of the newborn baby.
