Persons that don't actually wait for trains
========================

He was already standing at the edge of the station bench when I
arrived. That struck me as odd, since he was actually, physically,
taking up an space that could have been better employed by sitting on
it. It was as if he was marking a bench slot. 

Maybe it was just a temporary situation. He was standing up out of wanting to
exercise himself, even mildly. Something he seemed to be needing
badly, since he was candle-shaped and slouching. Maybe to compensate,
or just because, he was balancing slightly on his heels, looking like
a single-pronged and bulbous tuning fork. 

I turned my gaze away, ready to dismiss it as another nut case out of
the dozens you meet during the daily commute. But he was well dressed,
well shaved and he had a certain air of authority about him. He did
not create a no-go zone of two meters around him as the other homeless
nutters did. Somebody was idly sitting by him, not paying him any
attention or wrinkling their nose or anything. 

The train arrived and everybody rushed to the closest open
door. Everybody but him. He remained rocking his body in the direction
of the train, and he continued doing so when I boarded the train and it left the
station. He was, at that moment, the only person left there.
