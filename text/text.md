Persons that don't actually wait for trains
========================

He was already standing at the edge of the station bench when I
arrived. That struck me as odd, since he was actually, physically,
taking up an space that could have been better employed by sitting on
it. It was as if he was marking a bench slot. 

Maybe it was just a temporary situation. He was standing up out of wanting to
exercise himself, even mildly. Something he seemed to be needing
badly, since he was candle-shaped and slouching. Maybe to compensate,
or just because, he was balancing slightly on his heels, looking like
a single-pronged and bulbous tuning fork. 

I turned my gaze away, ready to dismiss it as another nut case out of
the dozens you meet during the daily commute. But he was well dressed,
well shaved and he had a certain air of authority about him. He did
not create a no-go zone of two meters around him as the other homeless
nutters did. Somebody was idly sitting by him, not paying him any
attention or wrinkling their nose or anything. 

The train arrived and everybody rushed to the closest open
door. Everybody but him. He remained rocking his body in the direction
of the tracks, and he continued doing so when I boarded the train and it left the
station. He was by then the only person left there.

I did not return to that particular tube station until a few weeks
after that, my bag holding a 3-d printed mock-up of the doorknob
design I had been charged with doing. Yes, I design
doorknobs. Somebody has to do it, right? Plus it is something that
people will hold, grab and pull thousands of times during its
lifetime. Beauty and material engineering, all in a single package,
right? I was getting off the train, and there he was, immaculately
dressed with a pinstripe suit that partially covered a
color-coordinated argyle sweater. Coordinate with a few argyles, that
is. He was meticulously shaved, and quite recently, by the shape of
the razor cut he had a bit to the left of the cleft chin. Great skin,
other than that. I put him in the surroundings of 30 years? Dressed
old-fashioned, gleaming shoes, and argyle socks, pinstripe and argyle,
so old-fashioned that it must be again fashionable. Argyle and
pinstripe is the new black, like his hair, liked back and overflowing
like a shot-up tail in the back of the head. 

And his hands. Endow him with a portfolio and he would be the
quintessential City yuppy. Not that yuppies exist any more, but then
nobody uses argyle nowadays either. But his hands were moving this way
and that, without his arms actually feeling that motion and hanging
loose at the sides of the body. 

I walked past him on my way to the lift out of the station and the
doorknob-showing. He was oblivious of my attention or, for that
matter, of anything else. For an instant after the train left he was
the only one left at the station.
